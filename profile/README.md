# We are MEP!

Hi, we are [MEP](https://mep.it) a Marketing and Communication Agency based in Bologna, Italy üáÆüáπ. We love open source, and we are beyond grateful for what other developers and companies have made possible for us through their contributions to the ecosystem. That's why we're happy to share the tools we've built to speed up and improve our daily work.

Below is a list of our currently available tools and their lifecycle status:

## üöÄ Stable

* [HashLips Lab](https://github.com/hashlips-lab)  
  Our team is actively maintaining many projects in this organization.
* _We can't wait to fill this section with tools you'll love!_ üí™

## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Experimental

* [@mep-agency/next-iubenda](https://github.com/mep-agency/next-iubenda)  
  This NPM package allows you to integrate the Cookie Solution by [Iubenda](https://www.iubenda.com/), the leading provider of privacy, cookie and consent solutions, into [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) projects. It provides the tools needed to quickly create consent-aware components, while still taking advantage of server-side rendering for the rest of the components.

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Deprecated

* [Web Toolkit (Symfony)](https://github.com/mep-agency/web-toolkit)  
  The Web Toolkit Bundle was a project that helped us develop and deploy [Symfony](https://symfony.com/)-based websites for our customers.

# Projects lifecycle, contribution and support policy

## Lifecycle Policy

Every project follows a three-step process. Our approach differs significantly depending on which stage a project is in.

* üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Experimental**  
  These projects are in the early stages of development and may be subject to change. We do our best to adhere to semantic versioning rules, but this cannot be guaranteed for experimental projects.
  Projects in this stage may be deprecated more quickly than stable projects if they become obsolete.
* üöÄ **Stable**  
  Stable projects are the ones we use every day for our business. They are intended to be maintained for a longer period of time, and we will do our best to deprecate them gracefully, unless new better options become available and seem suitable for replacement.
* ‚ôªÔ∏è **Deprecated**  
  Deprecated projects have reached their end of life and are no longer supported. We encourage everyone to move to alternatives as soon as possible.

## Contribution Policy

Everything you find here is used by our company to improve our work or build products for our customers. Our development roadmap and efforts are always focused on what matters most to our team and our customers.

Here are a few simple rules if you want to contribute:
1) All of our projects are provided "as is" with no warranties. There may be bugs and they may lack features as they are developed based on our specific needs. Please refer to the LICENSE file in each project for more information on how to properly use our code in your projects.
2) **Bug reports are very welcome**, please feel free to open an issue in any repository, but make sure you give us enough information to understand and reproduce the problem you are facing. **Incomplete reports will be closed as invalid.**  
   Bugs are limited to existing features that are broken or do not behave as expected.
3) **A missing feature is not a bug.** If you need a feature to be added, you can suggest it and we will consider working on it or ask for a PR from you or any other contributor willing to help.
4) **PRs are very welcome**, but please make sure you discuss any new feature with us before working on it to avoid wasting your time. We will consider merging PRs based on many factors such as **quality and maintainability**.  
   We may notify you of the need for specific contributions if we can't work on some features/fixes ourselves. Help with these would be greatly appreciated and may be rewarded (if clearly stated).
5) Projects follow a lifecycle policy explained below, please make sure you check the current project status before using it.

## Support Policy

Our support policy is quite simple:
* We provide free support, to the best of our ability, for all reported bugs for both `stable` (high priority) and `experimental` (low priority) projects. **We cannot guarantee support for deprecated projects.**
* Feature requests and PRs are welcome, but we may reject them based on our internal roadmap and our customers' needs.
* We can provide paid support and custom development if needed. Feel free to contact us for a quote.
* We provide additional support for partners and holders of certain NFTs (see below).

# We support ODC members!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Nothing on this page is financial advice** and we ancourage everyone to do their own research and make sure they fully understand what's behind any of the projects mentioned.

Open Devs Crew (ODC) is a **decentralized** NFT collection so **there is no "official team" leading it**. Neither our company nor the original founders have any control over what the community will do in the future **until further notice**.

<div align="center">

</div>

We strongly believe in the [Open Devs Crew](https://opendevs.io) project and we want to support its members as much as possible. That's why will provide ODC holders with **priority on support requests** for any tool maintained by us for free.

If you are a holder you can simply open an issue in any of our repos and notify the team in the [ODC Discord private channel](https://discord.gg/TPmGaMXdHw) to help us with discovering holders' requests.

Please remember the support is provided up to our availability and responsiveness may vary depending on the workload. The projects' lifecycle decribed above also applies to ODC requests, for instance: we might not be able to provide support for deprecated tools, but we'll do our best to help as much as possible.
